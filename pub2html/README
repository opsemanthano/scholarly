Secondary Authors: M.J. Jubb , Author's of NCSA HTTPD Server and
		   Oscar Nierstrasz ( original perl script author ).

Package Information:

	Files: accent, accent.pl, bib, bib.pl	(Perl scripts)
	       pub2html.1			(Manual page)
	       pub2html.c			(C source)

	Requirements:
			gcc or cc compiler.
			perl interpreter.

Installed Directory:	/usr/local/etc/httpd/pub2html/

Perl Information:

-	All perl scripts used were tested on pre-release version 5 of perl.
-	Perl was installed into '/usr/local/bin/perl' ( executable ) and 
	perl libraries in '/usr/local/lib/perl5'.

-	The perl scripts used in this distribution can easily be modified to
	your own tastes. These scripts are compiled at run time and executed;
	just like the ye old BASIC language and possibly forth.

-	The perl scripts control the HTML language generation and reference
	parsing. They generate Abstract.html, Index.html files depending on
	the switches used in 'bib'.

-	The 'bib' perl script has a new command called '-redirect' to 
	write stdout data to a file. The filename has only alphanumeric 
	characters, so no path information can be used. This was used to
	enable perl to run under the effective user ID of root and run
	as securely as possible.

C Source Information:

-	pub2html assumes that the httpd server has been configured in
	the directory '/usr/local/etc/httpd' and will read the 'srm.conf'
	file found in '/usr/local/etc/httpd/conf' directory.

-	The 'srm.conf' file uses the NCSA HTTPD Server format and pub2html.c
	may need substantial recoding if the parsing routines fail to read it.
	As far as the author knows, this may only be a problem with other
	httpd servers like the CERN one ??!!

-	Our Web Server is configured to provide aliases for the following :-

	/icons/		<httpd_server_installed>/icons/
	/pics/		<httpd_server_installed>/pics/
	/publications/	<publication_location>/

	/username/	<user home directory>/public_html/

-	The first parameter eg. '/icons/' is the server fake directory and
	the other parameter tells the server what directory to access when
	called by the fake directory.

-	The '/publications/' parameter is system administrator defined as
	is the valid users whom appear via '/username/'.

-	It is standard practice to have user login names as the users
	home directory, and this is used to check for valid users.
	If a valid user is found then pub2html continues, otherwise it
	exits and says the user has not been licensed.

-	Quota Defines are set up, as our system which uses an automounter
	to cross mount disks.
-	The program is set up to only run under IS_CAPELLA, this is due
	to simplifying the file locking mechanism.

-	The file lock works on the dummy file PROTECT and the new user or
	last user who used the program apperas in the WHO file.

-	There are definitions for the programs 'cp', 'mv', 'compress'
	and 'gzip' to be altered, depending on how your system was/is 
	configured.

-	The definition for LOGNAME is used to find the real user running
	pub2html. This is used to read the LOGNAME environment variable.
	On Sun SPARC stations, this name does not alter if you become
	super-ueser ( using 'su' ).

-	The program runs with an effective user as root ( ie. full
	privaledges ) and is required for the quota and file copy/management
	systems used by the program.

SYSTEM INSTALLATION:

- modify files as you see fit using above information as a guide.

- compile with cc or gcc

	cc -DDEBUG -o pub2html pub2html.c

or
	gcc -DDEBUG -o pub2html pub2html.c

- Where -DDEBUG is optional.

- change ownership etc.. ** WARNING : must be super-user to do this !! **

	chown root pub2html
	chmod 4755 pub2html	# the 4000 sets execute with user ID of file.

- install pub2html in a globally accessable file

	cp pub2html /usr/local/bin/pub2html
or
	mv pub2html /usr/local/bin/pub2html

- install man page

	cp pub2html.1 /usr/local/man/man1/pub2html.1

- and enjoy the package.

WARNINGS:
	 If a user sends the same reference file into the program,
	 this will enlarge the Publications.html reference file and
	 the program might get very confused.

	 It is up to the users to create meaningful and unique names for
	 there postscript files and labels ( if they want there own  -
	 see the manual page ).

EXTENSIONS:
	Remove -redirect option from bib and allow pipes that duplicate the
	stdout of the child process and use this to write directly into a
	file controlled by the parent.

	Possibility of running perl using the libperl.a library from within
	the C programme.

	Fixing all posible errors involving limited number of charcters for
	the path and also providing proper error detection and correction.

SUITABILITY:
	This package is suitable for insstallation on computers which
	have there own web server ( httpd ) as pub2html uses the server's
	configuration information to operate. ( Publications directory and 
	valid user determination. )

	If the user just wants to control his own published papers then
	the perl scripts are all that are required.
