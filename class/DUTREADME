BUGS:-
------

	listofsymbols and listofabbreviation pages may have formatting problems
	when in draft mode. This appears as a black space character at the right	hand side margin.

Extensions / TO DO:-
--------------------

	Add \qualifications command to print previous degrees in title page.
	Add \partno, \totvol for multiple volume thesis support.
	In `FLASH' mode, allow more inter-letter spacing in the "chapter",
	 either by using the linespace package or magnifing the font.
	Overcome any bugs / future bugs
	Improve LaTeX 2e style.
