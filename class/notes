This thesis style is based on Durham University's guidelines and
British Standards 4821:1990 sections 4, 7 and 12.


(i)   The paper size is A4 and printed single-sided.
(ii)  At least 20 mm margins should be left all round EXCEPT the left-hand 
      margin of 40 mm to allow for binding.
(iii) Double or 1.5 spacing should be used throughout EXCEPT for indented
      quotations or footnotes, where single spacing is adequate.

Most of the other guidelines are/can be achieved automatically via the various
LaTeX tools like BiBTeX.

To save typing of bibliographic entries in BiBTeX format, I type in an old
reference format having '%A' for author etc... To convert this into bibtex 
format i use refer2bibtex.pl.0.9.0 running on PERL 4.0. I don't know
if this perl program will run/function with perl 5.x. As it did not run 
properly with my perl 5.000 version.

In England/UK Academia have access to the bids database; on the web there are
perl and C programs which mutate bids output into either bibtex style or reference style. Hence the need/use of refer2bibtex ! I think most of these are
archived on the CTAN bibliography section (UK definitely - ftp.tex.ac.uk)
